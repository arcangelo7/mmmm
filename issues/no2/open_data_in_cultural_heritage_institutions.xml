            <p>Treating collections in cultural institutions as data encourages novel approaches to the use of historic collections. To reframe collections as data is to focus on how digitized collection material, collection metadata, and transcriptions can be used and reused for various types of computational analysis. Scholars active in the field of digital humanities have long taken advantage of computational data. This paper focuses on the work of cultural heritage institutions, which are increasingly offering collections as data. This paper outlines the collections as data project and examines specific examples of cultural institutions active in this space. The paper then details the practices of data brokers, and explores how the data broker model can frame the use of data in cultural heritage institutions. In closing a number of experiments are described that might help mitigate the harm that data in cultural institutions might cause. As we create and share data, can we be sure we are better than data brokers?</p>

                <p>Recently, increased attention has been paid to data in cultural
                        institutions. In both <time when="2016">2016</time> and <time when="2017">2017</time>,
                    the Library of Congress hosted conferences on the use of library collections as

                    Services (IMLS) funded a two-year project, Always Already Computational (AAC),

                <p>The AAC project has done a great deal of important work in bringing together a
                    wide variety of practitioners and examples and for this reason situating an
                    exploration of data in cultural heritage institutions within the framework of
                    the collections as data conversation is beneficial. As a catalyst within a wider
                    world of data-oriented endeavors in cultural institutions, the AAC project has
                    opened new avenues of investigation and has amplified the need for collaboration
                    among institutions and practitioners. It is becoming increasingly common to see
                    issues related to data in special collections libraries appearing in syllabi,
                    library strategic goals, and position papers<ref type ="biblioRef" target="#b05">5</ref>.

                <p>Collections as data explores an expansive definition of data. “To see collections
                    as data begins with reframing all digital objects as data,” <span type="person">Thomas Padilla</span>
                    writes. <quote rend="inline">Data are defined as ordered information, stored
                        digitally, that are amenable to computation. Wax cylinders, reel to reel
                        tape, vellum manuscripts, websites, masterworks, musical scores, social
                        media, code and software in digital collections are brought onto the same
                        field of consideration</quote><ref type ="biblioRef" target="#b07">7</ref>. In addition to digital collections being
                    reconceptualized as data, the metadata — such as titles, descriptions, dates —
                    can also be rethought as data. <quote rend="inline">Data as well as the data
                        that describe those data,</quote> explains the Santa Barbara Statement,
                        <quote rend="inline">are considered in scope. For example, images and the
                        metadata, finding aids, and/or catalogs that describe them are equally in

                <p>In many ways treating collections as data eases some barriers to sharing data.
                    However, collections as data is not the same as open data. Open data has few, if
                    any restrictions on use and reuse<ref type ="biblioRef" target="#b08">8</ref>. <quote rend="inline"

                    are usually easier to share, however, there are still many reasons that the data
                    might not be open.

                <p>In November 2019 the AAC grant project came to an end and was succeeded by a new
                    phase, Collections as Data: Part to Whole (“Part to Whole” n.d.). Collections as
                    Data: Part to Whole fosters <quote rend="inline">the development of broadly

                <p>The AAC team has compiled a number of Facets, or case studies that draw attention
                    to many ways cultural institutions are creating and using data. These

                <p>In addition to sharing metadata, many libraries and museums are allowing full
                    access to digital facsimiles. The Getty, for example, <quote rend="inline">makes
                        available, without charge, all available digital images to which the Getty

                <p>Beyond metadata and digital facsimiles, collections reformatted as structured
                    data is also a growing trend in cultural institutions. This often involves
                    transcribing text and applying some type of structure. Haverford College
                    Libraries reformatted collections into TEI-encoded text for the projects <title

                        Explorer for Colonial Zapotec</title><ref type ="biblioRef" target="#b18">18</ref>. Reformatting the collections as structured data
                    allows for enhanced linkages between items as well as customized interfaces. The
                    Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) structured exhibition data in a database, and shared
                    as a CSV (Lill n.d.). This project has resulted in a rich history of past MOMA
                    exhibitions.</p>
                <p>A fuller exploration of a particular open data project will help highlight both
                    the process and possible pitfalls of collections as data work in cultural
                    heritage institutions. The American Philosophical Society Library (APS)
                    digitized, reformatted as data, and opened historic prison records. The APS
                    holds three admission books created by the Eastern State Penitentiary. The books, covering the years
                    <time when="1830">1830</time>-<time when="1850">1850</time> (with a gap in the 1840s), hold
                    information on each prisoner,
                    including name, age, the crime(s) for which they had been found guilty, the
                    sentence, and often a note on when they were freed (or died). Also included,
                    though less consistently, is gender, race, and religious affiliation.
                    Additionally, notes from the moral instructor appear for each record; similar to
                    contemporary prison parsons, moral instructors were non-denominational religious
                    authorities and they recorded a paragraph-length note on each inmate which
                    details the religious education of the prisoner as well as other biographical
                    elements.</p>
                <p>In <time when="2015">2015</time>, the team digitized the admission books. At this
                    point, the scanned images of the pages of the admission books could be treated
                    as data. As data, they are open to computational analysis. Just as digital
                    representations of paintings allow the application of computer models to extract
                    information and recombine it to find new patterns and propose linkages between
                        pieces, the pages of the prison
                    admission books can be treated as data. For example, by analyzing the pages as
                    data, one could ask if the handwriting changes based on the positive or negative
                    attributes ascribed to the prisoner.</p>

                <p>Taking the process one step further, in <time when="2016">2016</time> and <time when="2017">2017</time>
                        the team
                    transcribed the
                    content into spreadsheets. The library published the
                    data as CSV files in a variety of outlets, including the APS Github repository<ref type ="biblioRef" target="#b19">19</ref> and the Magazine for Early American Datasets<ref type ="biblioRef" target="#b20">20</ref>. The workflow was simple: each transcriber had two
                    computer monitors, one to see the digitized page and the other to type into a
                    spreadsheet. The information on the pages are mostly consistent. For example,
                    the first line of each entry usually includes the prisoner’s name, age, crime
                    for which he or she is incarcerated, race (usually if non-White), and location
                    of birth (if outside of US). The repetition and consistency enabled the
                    information to be captured with few issues. </p>
                <p>However, the process is not always obvious, and choices do matter. For example,
                    the handwriting can often be difficult to read, and conventions about how to
                    depict abbreviations, spelling errors and indecipherable words had to be
                        established. Sometimes racial categories are mentioned, such as <term>black</term>,
                    or <term>light black</term>. Sometimes, on the same place on the page, religions
                    are mentioned, such as <term>Catholic</term>. Sometimes the birth location is
                    listed near the same place on the page, such as “Irish”. It is easy to imagine
                    that the categories of race, religion, and birth location were doing
                    interpretive work for both the creator of the records and the intended audience.
                    Jacksonian America was a time of great anxiety of immigration and saw a large
                    number of race riots<ref type ="biblioRef" target="#b21">21</ref>. The transcription team
                    needed to make decisions about how to group these pieces of information. Records
                    are not neutral; the process of transcription is not neutral.

                <p>From the point of view of the APS Library data initiatives team, the CSV files
                    themselves are the finished product. The Open Data Initiative of the APS Library

                    under the title <title rend="quotes">Eastern Apps: Visualizing Historic Prison

                    collections as data for digital humanities projects, and has served to help the
                    APS Digital Scholarship Center promote the use of other datasets to digital

                </p>
                <p>As the examples in this section highlight, collections as data in cultural
                    institutions can take many forms. Metadata enables the re-imagining of art
                    collections, as in the case with the Carnegie Museum of Art. Digitized objects
                    allow use and reuse for both scholarly and imaginative purposes. Collection
                    content can be transcribed as structured open data allowing for analysis,
                    visualizations, access through innovative interfaces, and new types of research.
                    However, there is always interpretive work that needs to be done when creating
                    datasets from cultural heritage material.</p>

                    griminess of the business is the ability to buy and sell personal information
                    about individuals. Names, addresses, social security numbers and other
                    information is passed from one buyer to the next, often emailed in spreadsheets.
                    The buyers hope to pressure the named individuals into paying the debts,
                    creating a profit for the debt buyer. While the <title rend="italic">Last Week

                    sell. <quote rend="inline">Some of the information data brokers collect, like
                        bankruptcy information, voting history, consumer purchase data, web browsing

                <p>The practice of data brokerage is secretive, and there is often no way to appeal

                    incorrect. <quote rend="inline">In the world of data brokers, you have no idea
                        who all has bought, acquired or harvested information about you, what they

                <p>In <time when="2017">2017</time>, Equifax announced a data breach that allowed the personal information of
                    143 million people to be stolen. In 2018, Facebook announced that the data
                    analysis company Cambridge Analytica used personal data in ways that easily
                    match <span type="person">John Oliver</span>’s definition of grimy. The use of personal data by companies
                    large and small to profit is an important backdrop against which to evaluate
                    open data in cultural institutions. Equifax and Cambridge Analytica are not,
                    technically, data brokers. The former is a credit monitoring company and the
                    latter, before declaring bankruptcy<ref type ="biblioRef" target="#b29">29</ref>, was a data
                    analysis firm. However, the role of data brokers, companies that buy, combine,
                    and sell personal information to other companies, is instructive for our
                    purposes, and the shades of differences can be grouped together for our
                    purposes. </p>
                <p>Data brokers, along with credit monitoring companies and data analytic companies,
                    benefit from the information of other people. This information often harms
                    individuals through the categories they create. Examples such as <quote
                        rend="inline"><q>single mom struggling in an urban setting</q> or <q>people
                            who did not speak English and felt more comfortable speaking in
                            Spanish</q> or <q>gamblers</q></quote><ref type ="biblioRef" target="#b31">31</ref>. Categories such as these, which are created,
                    populated, and shared by data brokers, make life harder for
                        individuals.
                    The data are also used to construct systems that target and harm individuals.
                    Advances in predictive policing, civilian surveillance, and backlashes against
                    activists are all the outcomes of systems built on data shared by and among
                    companies representing us in categories we cannot appeal<ref type ="biblioRef" target="#b32">32</ref><ref type ="biblioRef" target="#b33">33</ref><ref type ="biblioRef" target="#b34">34</ref><ref type ="biblioRef" target="#b35">35</ref>.</p>
                <p>Data brokers offer an important example of one way of interacting with data. This
                    is an example against which we should compare ourselves when we release data in
                    cultural institutions and use data for digital humanities. We should always ask
                    ourselves, are we better than data brokers? </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
                <head style="h2">Are We Better Than Data Brokers?</head>
                <p>Data brokers profit from other people’s information. Those described in their
                    datasets often have no way of knowing how they are being represented, and have
                    no way of questioning or correcting this representation. As data becomes more
                    prevalent in cultural institutions, and many of us — through publishing papers
                    and presenting on our work — benefit from data about other people, now is good
                    time to evaluate ourselves in relation to data brokers. This section explores
                    examples of harm done by institutions as they represent individuals and groups. </p>
                <p>Identifying specific cases of harm can be difficult. For this reason, it is
                    common to focus on groups that are historically marginalized, and who have
                    reason to be suspicious of their representation in mainstream culture. Anyone
                    who has ever had a reason to fear categorization by a dominant culture can more
                    easily understand the power of data. Many groups have reason to be suspicious.
                    For the purposes of this paper, however, examples will focus on African American
                    representations. This decision is meant to both draw attention to the unique
                    position of the African American community as a marginalized group and to honor
                    the important work of generations of scholars who struggle to educate the
                    dominant culture about these and related dangers.</p>
                <p>Are people harmed by the data that we have and share? It is not standard practice
                    for cultural institutions to share social security numbers, credit card numbers,
                    or other sensitive personal information in either physical records, digitized
                    facsimiles, or datasets.
                    As such, there is a significant difference between us and the work done by data
                    brokers. Even with standardized practices in place to protect individuals,
                    cultural institutions, historically, have done a form of harm to groups though
                    representation. If we do not take this seriously now, we are likely to compound
                    the problem through our open data. </p>

                <p>In what way are cultural institutions doing the same? The collecting practices of
                    cultural institutions have long been marred by the racial bias of the archivists
                    and curators who build collections. The decisions made about what is collected
                    are colored by the opinions of those doing the collecting and this has tipped
                    the scales on how African Americans are represented in archives. An overt
                    example from the author's own institution is a case in point. In <time when="1945">1945</time>,
                    the LSU
                    Department of Archives and Manuscripts (a pre-curser to the current Special
                    Collections) was offered the opportunity to acquire the collection of African
                    American bibliophile and book collector, <span type="person">Henry P. Slaughter</span>. The quality of
                            the
                    collection was endorsed by archivist <span type="person">Herbert Kellar</span> and book dealer <span type="person">Forest Sweet</span>
                    who wrote, <quote rend="inline">it is no sense a collection to be filed away -
                        it is rather a collection to be worn out with legitimate use for what it can

                <p>Despite this endorsement, the University eventually passed on the acquisition on
                    the advice of Archivist and History Professor, <span type="person">Edwin Davis</span>:
                    <quote rend="inline">the collection has been selected with the plan to emphasize
                        the Negro’s point of view of the race problem. If this is true it is my
                        opinion that the collection will have a considerable amount, perhaps an
                        appreciable percentage, of what might be termed weak material. I have
                        however, no evidence for this opinion. It might prove to be a very valuable

                <p>What is collected matters, and so does its description. The role of the library
                    catalog in reinforcing dominant points-of-view has been explored many
                        times.
                    <span type="person">Melissa Adler</span>, for example, draws attention to the <quote rend="inline">ways

                            library
                    classifications as they map to racist ideas active in the late 19th and early
                    20th centuries. The library catalog freezes these ideas in place, <span type="person">Adler</span>
                            claims,
                    and makes them look natural and obvious, similar to the manner of the
                    pseudo-science <span type="person">Pilgrim</span> describes.</p>
                <p>The business of gathering, combining, and selling data is not new. However, the
                    scope of surveillance and reach of the systems created with the data is
                    unprecedented due to new tools and methods. In the same way, library catalogs
                    have long represented groups of people in problematic ways. What is different is
                    the new tools and methods we are using to promote the use and reuse of these
                    descriptions and collections. The collections as data framework in cultural
                    institutions carries with it the possibility for our descriptions of people to
                    be shared, combined with other data, and used to negatively affect groups. The
                    ability to exert <quote rend="inline">control over group and personal identity

                <head style="h2">How Can We Be Better? </head>
                <p>This section posits three possible directions that are still in the early phases
                    of exploration. These possibilities are listed as sincere efforts to investigate
                    possible steps toward a future in which my work with data feels less grimy. As
                    white librarians, we work in a field that has long struggled to be inclusive to
                    historically marginalized communities.
                    We hope to implement these steps as experiments at our current institution, and
                    to join a community of practitioners exploring these topics in different
                    settings. These experiments are meant to inform the practice of collections as
                    data — as it relates to metadata, digital facsimiles, and structured data — as
                    well as the practice of digital humanities. These approaches are informed by
                    literature on empathy, data science, and critical librarianship. </p>
            <div type="section">
                <head style="h3">Empathy and Description</head>
                <p>The grimy business of data brokers is legal.
                    While it is important that cultural institutions follow laws when we rethink our
                    collections as data, and when we use this data to build digital humanities
                    projects, this alone will not be enough. For example, the Health Insurance
                    Portability and Accountability Act of <time when="1996">1996</time> (HIPPA) provides privacy protection
                    for health-related data (Health and Human Services <time when="2015">2015</time>), and, as we saw above,
                    it is established practice in cultural institutions not to share sensitive
                    financial or personal information about people represented in the collection.
                    However this is not enough. A thin legalistic understanding of what should and
                    should not be shared will never be robust enough to ensure we do not harm people
                    we represent. There are no laws, of course, against harmful library subject
                    headers or terminology. </p>
                <p>Arguing for a move away from thin legalistic frameworks, Michelle Caswell and
                    <span type="person">Marika Cifor</span> explore the role of feminist ethics in reconceptualizing the role
                    of archives and the people represented in our collections. This approach is
                    applicable for all cultural institutions, collections as data work, and digital
                    humanities projects that use this data. <quote rend="inline">In a feminist

                    could we ensure that this happens? The particular individuals described in

                    institutions creating and releasing data, and to digital humanist using the
                    data, we could bring in experts in African American Studies, for example, if our
                    data represents the African American community, or Women and Gender Studies, if
                    applicable. The expertise from their subject could be brought to bear within the
                    cultural institution creating the data and within the digital humanities group
                    working with the data. In short, we can ask for help.
                </p>
                <p>Many cultural institutions are unlikely to be able to create new professional
                    positions specifically for individuals trained in the histories of marginalized
                    communities. However, it is critical that we find ways to pay the scholars whose
                    help we seek. In academic libraries and archives this might take the form of
                    graduate assistantships. Digital humanists will likely be similarly restricted.
                    However, including these roles in project plans and grant applications is one
                    way to normalize the process of asking for help. Money is not the only
                    incentive; this could be a valuable means of exposing scholars to possible
                    careers in cultural institutions and digital humanities. However, monetary
                    compensation is an important part of letting scholars know we take their
                    expertise seriously. </p>

                <p>As we have seen, it can be very difficult to know what information data brokers
                    have about us, and to correct what is incorrect.
                    Is there any reason why cultural institutions cannot do better? We could include
                    feedback channels for the systems we create, and we could make our decisions as
                    transparent as possible. We can bring in experts in the history of marginalized
                    communities, as discussed above. We can also take a step further by ensuring
                    that anyone — those we identify as experts and invite into the process, and
                    those we do not — has a chance to ask us about our decisions and suggest
                    alternate practices. We could ensure that every data project includes feedback
                    options for people to ask questions and make suggestions. After all, we will not
                    be able to invite everyone to work with us, but we could try to include everyone
                    who is affected by our representations. </p>

                <p>We can also include context in downloadable data. For example, the CSV files that
                    constitute the core of the historic prison data project, described above, have
                    the transcriptions of the admission books. No metadata is included in the
                    download, and no context. Instead of simple files containing structured
                    transcriptions, we could use data packets to bundle contextualizing information
                    together with the transcriptions. As we
                    release collections as data we could standardize the inclusion of context; as we
                    promote data from cultural heritage institutions, we could normalize the process
                    of incorporating the context supplied within data packages. </p>
                <p>Part of the context we could add would be explanations about decisions that we

                    proposes we frame collections data work in cultural heritage institutions within
                    a new paradigm, a collections-as-data paradigm, that considers both the
                    conceptual and practical concerns related to the use of data in archives<ref type ="biblioRef" target="#b44">44</ref>. The benefits of framing a paradigm around
                    collections-as-data, <span type="person">Mordell</span> argues, is to <quote rend="inline">ensure that a

                    descriptions of the holdings will look objective and natural, and the work of
                    archivists and others to show how archival collections are never neutral and
                    natural will be obscured. <span type="person">Mordell</span> argues that <quote rend="inline">active

                    practical implementation toward the goal of ensuring that the work we do is
                    better than data brokering. There is still much to learn, and the implementation
                    of any of these proposed solutions will certainly open new possibilities, of
                    both success and failure. Many of the issues we hope to address have taken

                <head style="h2">Conclusion</head>
                <p>The examination of data brokers is meant to offer a warning to those of us
                    working in cultural heritage institutions. However, it is not just one example
                    taken at random. Rather it is a generative lens to view our work because we are
                    always already existing as data in the world of data brokers. The power that
                    data brokers have over us to collect, analyze, describe, and sell our data
                    should bring into sharp focus the power that we have over those with whose data
                    we work.</p>
                <p>Thinking about collections as data framework creates an ideal moment for a
                    reflection on the creation and use of data in cultural institutions and digital
                    humanities. This reconceptionalization enables unprecedented access and
                    interaction with collection material in libraries, archives, and museums,
                        <quote rend="inline">including but not limited to text mining, data

                <p>This is also a moment to consider how we do not want to interact with data.
                    Having a ready example against which to judge our behavior is useful, and data
                    brokers provide a perfect use case. Companies that buy, combine, and resell
                    personal data to the detriment of individuals and groups can be the example we
                    need. Defining ourselves in contrast to data brokers also grants us the
                    opportunity to reflect on the historically problematic aspects of cultural
                    institutions’ descriptive practices. </p>
