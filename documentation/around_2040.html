    <h2>Around 2040</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>General idea and purpose</h3>
                <p>We imagined a future of <strong>sci-fi</strong> and <strong>cyberpunk</strong> themed publishing, inspired by a wide range of films, TV series and video games of this genre, such as <em>Blade Runner</em> (1982), <em>Tron Legacy</em> (2010), <em>Black Mirror</em> (2011-2019), <em>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</em> ( 2011) and <em>Deus Ex: Makind divided</em> (2016), <em>Detroit: Become Human</em> (2017) and <em>Altered Carbon</em> (2018-2020).</p>
                <p>Against a background of <strong>interconnected circuits</strong>, the foreground text is contained in a box that simulates a mobile device. As early as June 2020, in fact, 50.88% of all internet traffic passes through smartphones, followed in second place by the desktop (46.39%) and in third place by tablets (2.74%).<a class="biblioRef" href="#b01">1</a> It is therefore legitimate to foresee an increasingly <strong>mobile-first future</strong>, in which websites are developed first for mobile and then for desktop.</p>
                <p>The tones are the dark and gloomy ones of a cyberpunk megalopolis, but the dark theme also alludes to the increasingly massive presence of screens in people's lives. So, on the one hand it is a metaphor of the "<strong>black mirror</strong>", on the other it is a real <strong>dark mode</strong> in order not to tire the eyes oppressed by too many stresses.</p>
            <h3>Base</h3>
            <h4>Margins</h4>
                <p>The goal is to create a <strong>tablet-like surface</strong> in the center of the screen. The inspiration comes from the magazines featured in the <em>Detroit: Become Human</em> (2017) video game, which are completely <strong>borderless</strong> and almost <strong>immaterial</strong> tablets.</p> 
                <p>To position the textual portion in the center, <strong>multiples of 24</strong> were used, since the theme must reflect the design of a hypothetical 2040. The text was therefore assigned a width of 72vw (24 * 3) and a top and bottom margin of 24vh. In addition, there is a <strong>24px margin</strong> between the headings and <strong>paragraphs</strong>.</p>
                <p>24 is a symbolic number for other reasons as well. The post-capitalist future will in fact be increasingly materialistic, a world where time is money: <strong>24 hours</strong> are in fact the day and pure gold is <strong>24 carat</strong>.</p>

            <h4>Background</h4>
                <figure id="f01">
                    <img src="../img/blade_runner_poster.png" alt="Blade Runner poster">
                    <p class="num">Figure 1.</p>
                    <p>City streets of LA, as pictured in the 1982 film Blade Runner.</p>
                </figure>
                <p>For the background color, a dark and opaque shade of blue was selected that recalled the <strong>sunless sky</strong> in the 1982 film <strong>Blade Runner</strong>.</p>
                <p>From a poster (<a class="figureRef" href="#f01">Figure 1</a>), the relevant color was then sampled and renamed Blade Runner fog.</p>
                <p>On this dark blue stands an <strong>intertwining</strong> of <strong>luminous circuits</strong>, an evident symbol of an increasingly <strong>technological</strong> and <strong>interconnected future</strong>.</p>
                <p>The design is also a reference to the typical iconography of the <strong>Tron Legacy</strong> film, with its <strong>streets</strong> and its <strong>luminous suits</strong>. The color was in fact sampled from the <a class="figureRef" href="#f02">following image</a>.</p>
                <p>To create the background and animation, we opted for an already animated <strong>vector</strong> image, which was not created from scratch but remodeled starting from a CodePen project by Noora Pirttilahti.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b02">2</a> Instead of the original Javascript function, the resulting svg image was taken and the style was integrated and modified directly within the file.</p>
                <figure id="f02">
                    <img src="../img/tron_legacy.jpg" alt="Tron Legacy poster">

            <h4>Scrollbar and selection</h4>
                <p>For the scrollbar, a solution was chosen that recalled a <strong>yellow LED strip</strong>. The selected color is bright yellow, but not too much, to avoid glare effects.</p>
                <p>The same color was also used for the selection, while the text takes on the background color.</p>

            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <h4>Font family</h4>
                <p><strong>Electrolize</strong>, designed by Valery Zaveryaev, was chosen as the main font. The style was inspired by the letters of a Russian commuter train and has a <strong>square techno design</strong>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b03">3</a></p>
                <p>For the <strong>titles</strong> of each level a different font was used, namely the one created by Disney for the logo of the film <em>Tron Legacy</em>, 2010.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b04">4</a></p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="prettyprint">

            <h4>Font-size & color</h4>
                <p>As for the margins, a number was chosen for the font-size that recalled the <strong>date 2040</strong>. Therefore the font for wide screens (min-width: 1200px) is <strong>24px</strong>.</p>
                <p>For the color of the text, on the other hand, a <strong>light gray</strong> was chosen that would not create too much contrast with the background and would give the <strong>feeling of fog</strong>.</p>
            <h4>Headers</h4>
                <p>In a self-respecting cyberpunk theme, <strong>glitches</strong> cannot be missing. The impression we want to convey is that of looking at text displayed on a <strong>monitor</strong> that has been <strong>dropped</strong> to the ground too many times and <strong>pixel alignment</strong> is <strong>disabled</strong>.</p>
                <p>To do this, we were inspired by the entirely CSS solution developed by Lucas Bebber<a class="biblioRef" href="#b05">5</a>, which however has been modified to obtain a less invasive effect.</p>

                <h4>Links</h4>
                    <p>For the links we have chosen the same blue LED color used for the circuits in the background, precisely because they are <strong>connections</strong>. For the <strong>hover</strong> effect, instead, we have selected an intermediate shade between the blue of the link and the gray of the text, a <strong>blue / gray</strong>, therefore.</p>

                <h2>Navbar and footer</h2>
                    <p>The navbar and footer play the role of frame for this <strong>sci-fi dashboard</strong>. On <strong>large screens</strong> (max-width: 1200px) they are in fact in a fixed position above and below the actual article.</p>
                    <p>Their frame task is underlined by the <strong>line</strong> that is not straight, but <strong>angular</strong> and recessed at the level of the central box-tablet, which also allows for gaining more space.</p>
                    <p>The same <strong>led yellow color</strong> used for the scrollbar and for the highlighting was then used to decorate the inclination of the two clipped sections and as a link separator in the navigation bar.</p>
                    <p>On <strong>smartphones</strong> (max-width: 600px) the navigation bar is always visible at the top, while the footer disappears and can be reached after reading the entire article.</p>
