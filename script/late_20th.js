    <h1>Late 20th Century</h1>
        <section>
            <h3>General idea and purpose</h3>
                <p>This theme is meant to reproduce the look and feel of the prominent, minimalistic theme used in the
                    second half of the 20th century by myriad high-profile periodicals. It is set in black and
                    white, as were the daily newspapers in the 20th century, and it uses multiple columns (based on
                    the screen width) to give the feeling of filling the page with as much information as possible.</p>
            <h3>Base</h3>
            <h4>The page divisions</h4>
                <p>Since it is not always easy to recognize where to end the current column division and start a new
                one and in order to avoid very long columns that are against the purpose and would render the whole
                    theme useless, we decided to divide into columns every chunk of text that falls in between two
                    headings (up to h3 to avoid very short sections). For this purpose, wherever we see a heading,
                    we span it through the entire width of the page to start a new section of columns afterwards. In
                    this way, we avoid long columns and also keep a neat look for the page</p>
            <h4>The border</h4>
                <p>The page is surrounded in both sides by a thin, grey border, again following the design patterns
                    of daily newspapers. The columns are separated by much thinner black lines.</p>

            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <h4>Font family</h4>
                <p>We chose Cheltenham as the font family for this theme, because of its serif look and the fact
                    that it was the main inspiration for the later font design for the New York Times.</p>
                <p>Headings in this font are in Italics and links are shown with underlines rather than a loud
                    change of color in order to keep the constant minimalistic feeling throughout the page.</p>
                </p>
            <h4>Font color</h4>
                <p>Every word in this theme is pure black. In the very few cases where a third color rather than white
                    and black was needed (eg. the background of the metadata tab) grey was used so as to maintain the
                    greyscale.</p>
        </section>

            <h3>Components</h3>
                <h4>Figures and tables</h4>
                    <p>Figures in this theme go through a CSS filter that renders them in greyscale, so that it has a
                        more authentic black and whiteâ€“era look.
                    </p>
                    <p>The tables only have a thin outer border to keep the clutter away.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Navbar and footer</h3>
                <p>The navbar and the footer are minimalistically designed, with the navbar filling the section for
                    the chosen page with grey so as to let the reader know where they are.</p>
