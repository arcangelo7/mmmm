    <h2>Before 1500: incunabula</h2>
    <h2>Base</h2>
    <h3>Margins</h3>
        <img src="img/golden_ration.png" alt="Golden ratio applied to the Gutemberg Bible">
        <p>The Argentinian typographiv design artist, Ra√πl Mario <strong>Rosarivo</strong> (1903-1966), was the fist scholar to analyze Renaissance books with the helps of compass and rulers and concluded that Gutemberg applied the golden canon of page construction to his work.</p>
        <p>The ratio of the <strong>width</strong> of the page (made up of the width of 9 tiles) to the width of the <strong>textbox</strong> (equal to the width of 6 tiles) is 9/6 = <strong>3/2</strong>. The same proportion is satisfied in the ratio of the <strong>length</strong> of the page to the length of the textbox.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the width of the <strong>inner margin</strong> of the page is made up of the width of <strong>1 tile</strong>, while the width of the <strong>outer</strong> margin is <strong>twice</strong> as large, for the reader's hands to hold the book open without covering any content. The same proportion is satisfied in the ratio of the <strong>lower</strong> margine to the upper one.</p>
    <h3>Background image</h3>
        <p>To replicate the effect of the <strong>ancient paper</strong>, an entirely <strong>CSS solution</strong> was preferred. A background image, in fact, would have had a greater impact on performance, since for large screens it would have been necessary to use very large and high-definition images.</p>
        <p>For this purpose, a <strong>linear gradient</strong> from left to right with six intervals was used, the values of which were obtained using an eyedropper on the Gutemberg Bible high definition images provided by the Bavarian State Library.</p>
    <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Font</h4>
            <p>The Gutenberg Bible is printed in the <strong>blackletter</strong> type styles that would become known as Textualis (Textura) and <strong>Schwabacher</strong>.</p>
            <p>This specific font has therefore been adopted for the theme, found via <a href="https://www.1001fonts.com/alte-schwabacher-font.html" title="Link to the Schwabacher font source" target="_blank">https://www.1001fonts.com/alte-schwabacher-font.html</a>.</p>
        <h4>Justification</h4>
            <p>After the invention of the printing press, the first printed page layout were <strong>modeled</strong> on the <strong>manuscript</strong> layouts. But over time one major difference was introduced - <strong>justified setting</strong>. Moreover, there is a greater use of <strong>white space</strong>, they were no longer as dark and dense as the medieval illuminated manuscripts. Some of this can be attributable to the advance of paper manufacturing technologies which created whiter and lighter papers.</p>
        <h4>Drop caps</h4>
            <img src="img/gutemberg_bible.png" alt="Gutemberg Bible">
            <p>The drop caps were also used in incunabula, modeled on manuscripts. However, while in the manuscripts they was always drawn by illuminators, in printed books two cases could occur: either pre-packaged movable types were used or an empty space was left to be filled later by hand by an illuminator.</p>
            <p>In the case of the Gutemberg Bible kept at the Bavarian State Library, which was taken as an example, the second case occurred and the <strong>drop caps</strong> are <strong>hand drawn</strong>. In particular, the <strong>first paragraph</strong> of a section has a <strong>historiated drop cap</strong>, while the <strong>following paragraphs</strong> simply have a larger font <strong>alternating red and blue</strong>.</p>
            <p>More specifically, the dropcap <strong>protrudes slightly out</strong> of the column, occupies <strong>two lines</strong> and has very <strong>little margin</strong> both at the top and on the right.</p>
    <h3>Headers</h3>
        <p>As for the color of the headers, the copy of Gutemberg's Bible in the Bavarian State Library was used as a reference. In fact, it is possible to view a high definition digitization at the site <a href="https://www.wdl.org/en/item/4102/view/1/1/" title="Gutemberg Bible viewer" target="_blank">https://www.wdl.org/en/item/4102/view/1/1/</a>.</p>
    <h3>Columns</h3>
        <p>The overall layout, modeled on classical <strong>two-columns layout</strong> of manuscripts, is elegantly balanced.</p>
        <p>The <strong>space between</strong> the two columns of text is equal to <strong>half</strong> of the <strong>left margin</strong>, for greater harmony.</p>
